[]About the compile by CodeWarrior

	It does not correspond to a script,
	 please do the following work manually before compile.

	* The alias of "zodiac/CWproject/conifg.h" is put on "zodiac/".
	* The alias of "zodiac/libmd/sdl/md_depend.h" is put on "zodiac/libmd/".
	* "zodiac/libmd/md.h.in" is copied and it renames to "md.h".
	* Open md.h and replace "@MD_DIR_LAYOUT@" to "MD_MAC".
